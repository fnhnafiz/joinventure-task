                    pain, ongoing for about 3 months, worse with activity,
                    especially stairs. Subjective: Patient describes the pain as
                    a dull ache, located medially. Rates it a 6/10 currently,
                    can go up to 8/10 after exercise. Some morning stiffness,
                    lasts maybe 15 minutes. No significant swelling reported,
                    denies locking or giving way. Uh... tried over-the-counter
                    Ibuprofen with some partial relief. No history of trauma.
                    Otherwise healthy. Objective: Gait is non-antalgic. Right
                    knee exam: No effusion visible. Mild tenderness to palpation
                    over the medial joint line. McMurray's test is negative.
                    Lachman and drawer tests stable. Range of motion is full,
                    though terminal flexion elicits some discomfort medially.
                    Assessment: Likely medial compartment osteoarthritis of the
                    right knee. Differential includes medial meniscus tear,
                    although less likely given exam findings. Plan: Uh... Obtain
                    bilateral weight-bearing knee X-rays. Recommend continued
                    NSAID use as needed, consider switching to Naproxen.

                    Subjective: Patient reports right knee pain ongoing for
                    approximately 3 months, described as a dull ache located
                    medially. Pain worsens with activity, particularly stair
                    climbing. Pain rated 6/10 currently, increasing to 8/10
                    post-exercise. Reports approximately 15 minutes of morning
                    stiffness. Denies significant swelling, locking, or episodes
                    of giving way. Partial relief noted with over-the-counter
                    Ibuprofen. No history of trauma. Patient is otherwise
                    healthy. Objective: Gait: Non-antalgic. Right Knee Exam: No
                    visible effusion. Mild tenderness to palpation over the
                    medial joint line. Full range of motion; terminal flexion
                    elicits mild medial discomfort. McMurray's test negative.
                    Lachman test negative. Anterior/Posterior Drawer tests
                    negative (knee stable). BMI: 24 Assessment: Medial
                    compartment osteoarthritis, right knee (probable). Rule out
                    medial meniscus tear (less likely). Plan: Order bilateral
                    weight-bearing knee X-rays (AP, lateral, sunrise views).
                    Recommend continued PRN NSAID use (consider trial of
                    Naproxen 500mg BID PRN). Discussed referral for Physical
                    Therapy focusing on quadriceps/hamstring strengthening.
                    Discussed lifestyle modifications. Follow up in 4 weeks to
                    review X-ray results and clinical progress. Consider
                    intra-articular corticosteroid injection or orthopedic
                    referral if symptoms persist or worsen.
